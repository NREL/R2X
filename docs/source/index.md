# R2X documentation

Translation plugins for ReEDS, PLEXOS, and Sienna model interoperability.

This repository contains the interoperability layer in the
[r2x-cli](https://github.com/NatlabRockies/r2x-cli) ecosystem. It connects
model-specific parsers and exporters through shared
[`r2x-core`](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/r2x-core) systems, rules, plugins,
data stores, and units.

## Start here

- [Getting started](getting_started.md) explains installation and how to choose
  a translation workflow.
- [Translation workflows](dev_workflow.md) contains contributor-oriented,
  end-to-end interoperability examples.
- [Architecture](architecture.md) explains the parser, interoperability, and
  exporter boundaries.
- [Development](development.md) covers repository checks and changes to
  interoperability packages.
