# R2X documentation

Translation plugins for ReEDS, PLEXOS, and Sienna model interoperability.

This repository contains the translation layer in the
[r2x-cli](https://github.com/NatlabRockies/r2x-cli) ecosystem. For the shared
plugin architecture, rule engine, `System`, `DataStore`, and units, see
[r2x-core](https://nrel.github.io/r2x-core/).

## Start here

- [Getting started](getting_started.md) explains installation and how to choose
  a translation workflow.
- [Translation workflows](dev_workflow.md) contains end-to-end Python examples.
- [Architecture](architecture.md) explains the parser, translation, and
  exporter boundaries.
- [Development](development.md) covers checks, adding translation directions,
  and maintaining translated documentation.
